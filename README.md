# EmoRubik
A fully functional 3x3x3 Rubik's cube created with Processing's software sketchbook as well as Object Oriented Java.

### Usage:
Download Processing Software Sketchbook and open Rubikscube.pde.

### Features:
* A fully functional 3x3x3 Rubik's cube that can turn the front/back/up/down/left/right layers.
* Upon startup, if you press the spacebar the cube will do a random scramble of 20 moves and reverse that scramble so the cube goes back to the starting state (This can be changed to remove the reverse, or increase/decrease the number of moves).
* There is a move counter at the bottom right corner which displays the amount of turns that have been recorded.
